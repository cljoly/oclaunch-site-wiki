OcLaunch is very easy to use.   
But first, let's install it. You have several options:

  + <doc href="#quick-and-dirty" type="hb">Easy way, without automatic update</doc>
  + <doc href="#zero-install" type="hb">Using 0install, to choose which
  precompilled binary you would use</doc>
  + <doc href="#opam" type="hb">Using Opam, for OCaml masters</doc>
  + <doc href="#sources" type="hb">From sources (especially for beta version)</doc>

<h3 id="quick-and-dirty">Quick and dirty (easy, without automatic update)</h3>

If you donâ€™t want to test OcLaunch with 0install or Opam as describeb below, you
can use the binary of 0install archives directly. Pick the right version
<ext-a href="https://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/v03/">in this
  directory</ext-a>. See <doc href="faq#download-area">the FAQ for details of the
organisation</doc>.

### Installation

#### TL;DR
**Goto this <ext-a href="https://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml">page</ext-a> and follow instructions.**

<h4 id="zero-install"><a href="http://www.0install.net">0install</a></h4>

##### Introduction

With this method, you will get a binary so that **you do not have to compile
the program**, which can be a quite complicated and long step.

##### Get 0install

If you do not have 0install installed: see [installation
instructions](http://0install.net/injector.html), especially <ext-a href="http://0install.net/users.html">here</ext-a>.

##### Install OcLaunch

You can find instructions on [this page][1].

You should create an alias, as explained on [this page][1].

```bash
$ 0alias oclaunch http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml
```

[1]: https://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml

###### Errors

If you get an error such as
```
export PATH=/home/you/bin/:$PATH
```
It means that `0install` can not define the new application in your `$PATH`.
So it define it elsewhere and want you to add this folder to your path. You
should add the `export...` line to your bashrc, so you can use 0install easier.

##### Test that all work

*In the rest of the document, we assume that the `oclaunch` command is found
if you enter it in your terminal.*    
To test, just open a new one and enter
```
oclaunch help
```
It should return something like this :
```
OcLaunch program is published under CeCILL licence.
You may run the program with 'licence' command or see http://cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL_V2.1-en.html (https://s.oclaunch.eu.org/cecill) for details. More here: https://oclaunch.eu.org/floss-under-cecill (https://s.oclaunch.eu.org/l).

  oclaunch.native SUBCOMMAND

Nice to meet you! Here is some tips to get started with OcLaunch.
Use 'help' subcommand to get help (it works both after the name of the software and with another subcommand). For instance run
`oclaunch help add`

=== subcommands ===

  run        Run the id sequence. Id sequence means a set of ids like this:
             1,4-9,17. The command is run for each item of the generated list
             (1,4,5,6,7,8,9,17 in this case)
  licence    Display the licence of the program
  add        Add the command given on stdin to the configuration file at a given
             position(s) ([id_sequence]). If nothing is given, or if it is out
             of bound, append commands at the end. Id sequence means a set of
             ids like this: 1,4-9,17. The command is run for each item of the
             generated list (1,4,5,6,7,8,9,17 in this case)
  edit       Edit the [COMMAND_NUMBER]th command of the rc file in your $EDITOR.
             May be used to add new entries, without argument, one new command
             per line.
             [COMMAND_NUMBER] may be a sequence of ids. Id sequence means a set
             of ids like this: 1,4-9,17. The command is run for each item of the
             generated list (1,4,5,6,7,8,9,17 in this case)
  list       Print a list of all commands with their number. Useful to launch
             with number. Displays a star next to next command to launch
  cleanup    Remove doubled entries, trailing spaces in them... Useful after
             manual editing or with rc file from old version
  delete     Remove the [COMMAND_NUMBER]th command from configuration file. If
             [COMMAND_NUMBER] is absent, remove last one.
             [COMMAND_NUMBER] may be a sequence of ids. Id sequence means a set
             of ids like this: 1,4-9,17. The command is run for each item of the
             generated list (1,4,5,6,7,8,9,17 in this case)
  state      Display current state of the program
  reset      Reinitialises launches for the command number [command] to [n].
             With both the [command] and the [n] argumennt, the command number
             [command] is resetted to [n]. With only the [n] argument, every
             entry in current tmp file is resetted to [n]. [command] may be a
             sequence of ids. Id sequence means a set of ids like this:
             1,4-9,17. The command is run for each item of the generated list
             (1,4,5,6,7,8,9,17 in this case)
  reset-all  Reinitialises launches for everything
  import     Import an rc file of version 0.2.x
  version    print version information
  help       explain a given subcommand (perhaps recursively)
```

##### Update

To update the software, you may use

```
0install update [the name you choose for oclaunch]
```

or

```
0launch -r http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml -version
```

This will allow you to refresh OcLaunch and display the new version number.

<h4 id="opam">Opam</h4>

You can install it with <ext-a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">Opam</ext-a>.

```
opam install oclaunch
```

If possible, try to use the latest version, which is not using the dependency
```core_extended``` quite long to build.

##### Want to build from an archive, git repository

Pick up the url of the code <doc href="/sources" type="page">in this list of
places</doc>. You will then do

    opam pin add oclaunch url

remplace `url` by the url picked up earlier.

You may find further instructions for the git repository in <doc href="/blog/git-opam" type="post">this
blog post</doc>.

<blockquote>
<p>Some old archives are not compatible with opam. Use the
<doc href="latest/quick-start#sources" type="hb">following method</doc>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="sources">From the <doc href="/sources" type="page">sources</doc></h4>

##### Why build from sources

Even if precompilled binaries are available, you may build the program from
source. You may not trust binaries and want to use code you verified yourself.     
Or you want to get the latest version, a beta one or to build from the
<doc href="/sources#git" type="page">git repository</doc>.

##### Building

Get the sources <doc href="/sources" type="page">in this list (both git and tarballs)</doc>.

You will find in the repository or in most archives an [Install.md
file](https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
Dependancies are listed. The main ones are <ext-a href="https://github.com/janestreet/core">Core</ext-a>
and <ext-a href="http://mjambon.com/yojson.html">YoJson</ext-a>.

Briefly, you may run

     ocaml setup.ml -configure
     ocaml setup.ml -build
     ocaml setup.ml -install

<doc href="/contact">Contact me</doc> if you have any problem.

### Use

#### Add command to launch

You may use ```oclaunch edit```. Your ```$EDITOR``` opens and let you enter your
commands (one per line). Close the editor when you are finish.

You can find ideas of command <doc href="latest/usage-tips" type="page">here</doc>.

#### Last step

Just add the following line to ```~/.bashrc```
```
oclaunch run
```

This will allow you to launch each command added on terminal call.

There are <doc href="/help" type="page">several solutions to get
