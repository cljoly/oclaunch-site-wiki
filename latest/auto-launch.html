### What auto-launch is and how to disable it

#### Concept

When you use a command like `oclaunch run`, without a number, oclaunch figures
out the next command to launch, if any, and then launch it.

This behavior constitutes *auto-launch*. It is intended to allow to place the
`oclaunch run` command in your `.bashrc` (or equivalent) and launch command one by one as terminals
are opened.

However, sometimes you spawn a terminal from inside a program like thunar or
[neovim](https://neovim.io) and you want this very terminal to work directly,
ignoring auto-launch directive, especially if oclaunch would run a long command,
during which you couldnâ€™t use the terminal.

#### Disable it

There are several options, so you can choose the most convenient:

##### Environment variable

You may set the environment variable `OC_DISABLE` to anything and auto-launch
will be disabled. This applies to current shell only.

###### Enable

``` sh
export OC_DISABLE
```

###### Disable

``` sh
unset OC_DISABLE
```

##### Tmp file

You can disable auto-launch system wide too, using commands below. This write a
value to tmp file and thus, the setting is applied system wide, until next
reboot.

###### Enable

``` sh
oclaunch enable
```

###### Disable

``` sh
oclaunch disable
```

##### Planned

 + Allow to disable even after reboot (using a file in ~/.config for instance)
 + Allow to disable per entry
