### Prerequisite

You have followed instructions on the <doc href="latest/quick-start" type="hb"/>.

### Let's start

To use OcLaunch with Taskwarrior, simply add
what you want.

For instance, add ```task +rdv``` and ```task ls``` with
``` bash
 $ echo 'task +rdv\ntask ls' | oclaunch add
```

That's it ! Now, each time you open a terminal (since `oclaunch run` is in your
bashrc), it will remind you your tasks.
