OcLaunch is very easy to use.   
But first, let's install it. You have several options:

  + <doc href="#quick-and-dirty" type="hb">Easy way, without automatic update</doc>
  + <doc href="#zero-install" type="hb">Using 0install, to choose which
  precompilled binary you would use</doc>
  + <doc href="#opam" type="hb">Using Opam, for OCaml masters</doc>
  + <doc href="#sources" type="hb">From sources (especially for beta version)</doc>

<h3 id="quick-and-dirty">Quick and dirty</h3>

If you donâ€™t want to test OcLaunch with 0install or opam as describeb below, you
can compile from <doc href="/sources" type="page">sources</doc> or use the binary inside 0install archives
<ext-a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/0install/">in this directory</ext-a>

### Installation

#### TL;DR
**Goto this <ext-a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml">page</ext-a> and follow instructions.**

<h4 id="zero-install"><ext-a href="http://www.0install.net">0install</ext-a></h4>

##### Introduction

With this method, you will get a binary so that **you do not have to compile
the program**, which can be a quite complicated and long step.

##### Get 0install

If you do not have 0install installed: see [installation
instructions](http://0install.net/injector.html), especially <ext-a href="http://0install.net/users.html">here</ext-a>.

##### Install OcLaunch

You can find instructions on [this page][1].

You should create an alias, as explained on [this page][1].

```bash
$ 0alias oclaunch http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml
```

[1]: http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml

###### Errors

If you get an error such as
```
export PATH=/home/you/bin/:$PATH
```
It means that `0install` can not define the new application in your `$PATH`.
So it define it elsewhere and want you to add this folder to your path. You
should add the `export...` line to your bashrc, so you can use 0install easier.

##### Test that all work

*In the rest of the document, we assume that the `oclaunch` command is found
if you enter it in your terminal.*    
To test, just open a new one and enter
```
oclaunch -help
```
It should return something like this : 
```
OcLaunch program is published under CeCILL licence. See
    https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch for details.

  oclaunch.byte [COMMAND NUMBER]

See https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch for help.

=== flags ===

  [--reset-tmp]  Reinitialises launches by deleting temporal file.
                 (aliases: -reset-tmp, -r)
  [-build-info]  print info about this build and exit
  [-version]     print the version of this build and exit
  [-help]        print this help text and exit
                 (alias: -?)
```

##### Update

To update the software, you may use

```
0install update [the name you choose for oclaunch]
```

or

```
0launch -r http://download.tuxfamily.org/oclaunch/oclaunch.xml -version
```

This will allow you to refresh OcLaunch and display the new version number.

<h4 id="opam">Opam</h4>

You can install it with <ext-a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">Opam</ext-a>.

```
opam install oclaunch
```

If possible, try to use the latest version, which is not using the dependency
```core_extended``` quite long to build.

##### Want to build from an archive, git repository

Pick up the url of the code <doc href="/sources" type="page">in this list of
places</doc>. You will then do

    opam pin add oclaunch-dev url

remplace `oclaunch-dev` by the name of the package and `url` by the url picked
up earlier.

You may find further instructions for the git repository in <doc href="/blog/git-opam" type="post">this
blog post</doc>.

<blockquote>
<p>Some old archives are not compatible with opam. Use the
<doc href="#sources" type="hb">following method</doc>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="sources">From the <doc href="/sources" type="page">sources</doc></h4>

##### Why build from sources

Even if precompilled binaries are available, you may build the program from
source. You may not trust binaries and want to use code you verified yourself.     
Or you want to get the latest version, a beta one or to build from the
<doc href="/sources#git" type="page">git repository</doc>.

##### Building

Get the sources <doc href="/sources" type="page">in this list (both git and tarballs)</doc>.

You will find in the repository or in most archives an [Install.md
file](https://gitlab.com/WzukW/oclaunch/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
Dependancies are listed. The main ones are <ext-a href="https://github.com/janestreet/core">Core</ext-a>
and <ext-a href="http://mjambon.com/yojson.html">YoJson</ext-a>.

Briefly, you may run

     ocaml setup.ml -configure
     ocaml setup.ml -build
     ocaml setup.ml -install

<doc href="/contact">Contact me</doc> if you have any problem.

### Use

#### Add command to launch
Add command throw ```cat | oclaunch -a```, enter your commands (one per line) and finish by
```Ctrl-D```.
They are put in ```~/.oclaunch_rc.json```.   
You can find an example on <doc href="rc-example" type="page">this wiki</doc>.

#### Last step
Just add the following line to ```~/.bashrc```
```
oclaunch
```

This will allow you to launch each command added on terminal call.

A complete help is displayed with
```
oclanch --help
```

A detailed example is available <doc href="v0.2/complete-example" type="hb">here</doc>.

Enjoy ;-)
