So you have <doc href="v0.2/quick-start">installed</doc> OcLaunch.
It is in your `bashrc` and works properly.

What to do now? In this document, we will explain a basic example.

### Daily backup with <ext-a href="http://www.tarsnap.com">Tarsnap</ext-a>

tarsnap
:   This software allows you to backup efficiently and securely on remote servers

Imagine you want to backup a *directory* before working on it.
This directory may contain text documents, for instance.

You could create a `cron` job but that's quite complicated and you want to be
sure to have a backup before start to work (you can't know what will append...).   
This is a perfect job for `oclaunch`.

We assume that your *backup command* is
```
tarsnap -c -f $(hostname -s)-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) &lt;directory&gt;
```
That's said, any other one is okay.

So you add your *backup command* to your `~/.oclaunch_rc.json` with ```-a```
command like this:   
```bash
 $ echo “tarsnap -c -f $(hostname -s)-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) &lt;directory&gt;” | oclaunch -a
```

And that's all.

Because `oclaunch` is in your `.bashrc`, it will be called each time you open a
terminal, when the backup command is called one time (the first one).

You may also add it (`oclaunch`) to your session autostart, if you do not open terminals enough.

### Want to simulate a computer restart?

Do you want to do a backup in the middle of a computer session?

Simply run
```
oclaunch -r
```

And `oclaunch` will behave as if you had restart !

You can also *run a command* from number (starts at 0).   
For example, instead of running your long backup command, enter:
```
oclaunch 0
```
(You can get the number with ```oclaunch -l```).
